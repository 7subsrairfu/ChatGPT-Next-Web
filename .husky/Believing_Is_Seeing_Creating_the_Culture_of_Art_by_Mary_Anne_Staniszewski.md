The book challenges the conventional notions of what constitutes art and how it is valued, produced, and displayed. Staniszewski argues that art is not a natural or universal category, but a social and historical construct that reflects the power and interests of different groups and institutions. She traces the origins and evolution of the term "art" and its related concepts, such as masterpiece, genius, creativity, style, taste, and aesthetic. She also examines the role of artists, critics, museums, galleries, and mass media in shaping the culture of art.
 
Staniszewski draws on a wide range of examples from different periods and cultures, including Paleolithic cave paintings, Renaissance frescoes, modernist paintings, ready-made objects, photography, installation art, and popular culture. She shows how art is influenced by political, economic, social, and ideological factors, as well as by personal and collective identities. She also questions the assumptions and biases that underlie the dominant narratives of art history and criticism.
 
Believing Is Seeing: Creating the Culture of Art is a provocative and insightful book that offers a new way of looking at art and its meanings. It is intended for anyone interested in art, culture, and society.[^1^]
  
The book has received positive reviews from critics and scholars, who praised Staniszewski's original and interdisciplinary approach to art history. The book was described as "a learned and deliciously subversive book" by the publisher[^1^], "a brilliant and provocative analysis" by the art critic Lucy Lippard[^2^], and "a groundbreaking work" by the historian Hayden White[^2^]. The book has also been translated into Korean and published as "This Is Not Art" in 2000 and 2007[^1^].
 
Staniszewski is also the author of another book on the history of exhibition installations at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, titled The Power of Display: A History of Exhibition Installations at the Museum of Modern Art (MIT Press, 1998). In this book, she examines how MoMA's exhibition design and display strategies have shaped the public perception and reception of modern art. She argues that MoMA's installations are not neutral or transparent, but rather reflect the museum's ideological and institutional agendas, as well as the cultural and political contexts of its time. She also explores how MoMA's exhibitions have influenced other museums and art spaces around the world.[^3^]
 
Staniszewski is currently an associate professor in the Department of the Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. She teaches courses on culture, art, and media in relation to political and social perspectives. She is also involved in various research and curatorial projects related to contemporary art and culture. She has co-edited several publications and organized symposia on topics such as social movement cultures, alternative art spaces, and contemporary slavery. She is also working on a book that analyzes race as a historical and cultural construct.
